## Task

Create a new single page web application (SPA). This application should request a dummy API to display a number of "Posts" made by different
"Users". Each preview of such a post should include the username of the author, the post title and the description. Each post also has a number
of "Comments" made by other users. These comments should be visible when clicking a post's 'show more' link, and should be displayed using,
e.g. a modal dialog, redirect/routing to a new page or expanding the existing post. Feel free to implement any interesting UI and UX ideas that you
have.

To do this use the dummy REST API http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/. Take a look specifically at the posts, comments and users endpoint.
A navigation bar should be implemented at the very top of the UI. The user should be able to navigate to the start page which consists of the post
views. When clicking on the "About" tab only a "lorem ipsum" text should appear on the screen.
Implement a very basic search field which helps the user search for a specific username. Only posts by this user should be visible after the
search.

For each component that you write you should create corresponding tests.
